# 09 — Decisions

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-06-14
**Scope:** Current decisions, explicit deferrals, and open questions.

## Current decisions

### Solana USDC only for the MVP

- **Where:** data model, architecture, API, testing.
- **Decision:** use Solana SPL USDC, with mainnet mint
  `EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v` and devnet mint
  `4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU`.
- **Reasoning:** USDC on Solana is cheap, familiar to donors, and easy to
  verify with common wallets/explorers.

### Donations are SPL token transfers to the vault ATA

- **Where:** `01-architecture.md`, `03-data-model.md`, `04-api.md`.
- **Decision:** monitor the vault USDC ATA and owner relationship. Native SOL
  transfers are not donation accounting events.
- **Reasoning:** the product is USDC-denominated; token-account filtering avoids
  confusing fee/replenishment transactions with donations.

### Canonical donor ledger is `ledger_events`

- **Where:** `03-data-model.md`.
- **Decision:** one append-only table stores event type, payload, previous hash,
  event hash, and creation time.
- **Reasoning:** public verification must commit to the donor-visible payload,
  not just typed-table identifiers or convenience rows.

### Typed tables/views are read models only

- **Where:** `03-data-model.md`, `04-api.md`.
- **Decision:** donation/disbursement/anchor read models may exist for query
  speed but are rebuildable from `ledger_events`.
- **Reasoning:** one source of truth avoids ambiguous verification.

### Anchor runner state is mutable but outside the ledger

- **Where:** `03-data-model.md`, `07-observability-and-ops.md`.
- **Decision:** `anchor_runs` owns status, errors, locks, and retries.
  `ledger_events` receives an `anchor_published` event only after the transaction
  is known.
- **Reasoning:** retry state is operational; donor history is immutable.

### Anchor memo is UTF-8 text

- **Where:** `02-invariants.md`, `04-api.md`, `08-testing-strategy.md`.
- **Decision:** use `ccv-anchor:<64hex head_hash>` in the Solana Memo
  instruction.
- **Reasoning:** the Memo program handles UTF-8 text; the payload is explorer
  readable and avoids invalid arbitrary bytes.

### Anchor commits to the pre-anchor head

- **Where:** `01-architecture.md`, `02-invariants.md`, `03-data-model.md`.
- **Decision:** an anchor transaction publishes the head before the
  `anchor_published` event is appended.
- **Reasoning:** the transaction signature is not known until after send; the
  anchor event must be covered by a later anchor.

### Treasury and anchor wallets are separate

- **Where:** `01-architecture.md`, `05-hosting-and-deploy.md`, `06-security-model.md`.
- **Decision:** the treasury wallet receives USDC and has no private key in
  CI/Workers; the anchor wallet signs Memo transactions and holds only SOL for
  fees.
- **Reasoning:** anchoring should not require a key that can spend donations.

### Helius auth uses configured `authHeader`

- **Where:** `04-api.md`, `05-hosting-and-deploy.md`.
- **Decision:** configure a Helius webhook `authHeader` value (token only, no
  `Bearer ` prefix) and extract the Bearer token from the incoming
  `Authorization` header before comparing.
- **Reasoning:** storing just the token is clearer and avoids conflating the
  HTTP scheme prefix with the secret value. The Worker strips `Bearer ` from
  the incoming header and compares only the token portion against the stored
  secret using constant-time comparison.

### Webhook processing uses a durable inbox

- **Where:** `01-architecture.md`, `03-data-model.md`, `04-api.md`.
- **Decision:** webhook requests ACK quickly after authentication and inbox
  write, then process asynchronously.
- **Reasoning:** Helius expects fast `200` responses; durable async processing
  handles retries and duplicate replay safely.

### Public beneficiary references are server-generated

- **Where:** `03-data-model.md`, `04-api.md`, `06-security-model.md`.
- **Decision:** public APIs use server-generated `public_beneficiary_ref` values
  or no reference. For `POST /api/disbursements`, callers may omit the field for
  generation or set it to `null`; caller-supplied strings are rejected with
  `422 VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- **Reasoning:** handles are sensitive pseudonymous data and should not become a
  public tracking key. `vault-api-write` is structurally separated from `bot-db`,
  so the safe MVP contract does not try to compare submitted refs with private
  handles or opaque IDs.

### Telegram bot identity uses HMAC refs and encrypted chat routes

- **Where:** `01-architecture.md`, `03-data-model.md`, `04-api.md`,
  `05-hosting-and-deploy.md`, `06-security-model.md`, `08-testing-strategy.md`.
- **Decision:** `bot-db.handles` stores `telegram_user_ref` derived with
  `HMAC-SHA256(TG_ID_HMAC_KEY, "tg-user:" + telegram_user_id)` and
  `telegram_chat_id_enc` as authenticated encryption of the Telegram chat route
  under `TG_CHAT_ENC_KEY`. It does not store plaintext Telegram user IDs or chat
  IDs at rest. `telegram_chat_key_version` records the encryption key version for
  route-key rotation.
- **Reasoning:** the bot needs stable lookup for incoming updates and a route for
  proactive delivery, but a `bot-db`-only leak should not expose Telegram account
  or chat identifiers.

### Gift-card code persistence is minimized

- **Where:** `03-data-model.md`, `04-api.md`, `06-security-model.md`.
- **Decision:** after delivery, store only status plus hash/last4. Temporary
  encrypted storage is allowed only with short TTL for retry.
- **Reasoning:** a full code is value-bearing secret data.

### Frontend framework is SvelteKit + Svelte 5 + TypeScript

- **Where:** `05-hosting-and-deploy.md`, `10-frontend-architecture.md`,
  `11-public-frontend-ux.md`, `12-operator-frontend-ux.md`.
- **Decision:** use SvelteKit 2.x with Svelte 5 runes, strict TypeScript,
  `adapter-cloudflare`, `pnpm`, `svelte-check`, ESLint/Prettier, Superforms +
  Valibot, Bits UI + shadcn-svelte, Playwright, and Vitest.
- **Reasoning:** aligns this repo with the durable project proposal at
  `/home/lord/Projects/myai/docs/proposals/sveltekit-as-default-web-framework.md`:
  typed routes/load/actions, explicit reactivity, strong boundary validation,
  Cloudflare deployment fit, and an agent-friendly standard library.

### Single Cloudflare account with two D1 databases

- **Where:** architecture, data model, security model.
- **Decision:** `vault-db` and `bot-db` are separate databases with separate
  Worker bindings inside one Cloudflare account. The stronger two-account
  Cloudflare split is rejected for MVP and the foreseeable future.
- **Reasoning:** the important MVP boundary is preventing normal vault code from
  reading bot identity mapping. Separate D1 databases, separate Worker bindings,
  separate secrets, and CI binding checks provide that boundary with much less
  operational overhead than managing two Cloudflare accounts. This does not
  protect against full Cloudflare account compromise or account-admin misuse, and
  the product must not claim that level of anonymity.

### Backend framework and data access

- **Where:** `01-architecture.md`, `04-api.md`, `05-hosting-and-deploy.md`,
  `08-testing-strategy.md`.
- **Decision:** all backend Workers use **Hono** for HTTP routing,
  **Zod** for request/response validation, and **Drizzle ORM** with the D1 driver
  for database access. The monorepo uses **pnpm** and **TypeScript strict** for
  all backend code.
- **Reasoning:**
  - Hono is edge-native, TypeScript-first, has a tiny bundle footprint, and is
    recommended by Cloudflare for Workers. NestJS, Express, and Fastify target
    long-running Node.js servers and require heavy `nodejs_compat` shims.
  - Zod gives schema-first boundary validation; schemas can be shared with the
    frontend via `packages/vault-core`.
  - Drizzle has native D1 support, is SQL-first, type-safe, and much lighter
    than Prisma. Prisma on Workers only works through a newer D1 adapter and is
    overkill for the small append-only ledger schema.
  - One language, one package manager, and one test runner keep the backend
    consistent with the frontend and reduce operational overhead.

### Single operator Worker holds `OPERATOR_TOKEN`; downstream Workers reached via service binding

- **Where:** `01-architecture.md` §"Operator Worker trust model",
  `04-api.md` (endpoint table, all operator endpoint sections),
  `05-hosting-and-deploy.md` (vault resources, secrets matrix),
  `12-operator-frontend-ux.md` §"Auth UX and token storage policy",
  `06-security-model.md` §"T7 Operator token leak",
  `07-observability-and-ops.md` §"F-11",
  `AGENTS.md`.
- **Decision:** introduce a new `vault-operator` Worker that is the
  **sole holder of `OPERATOR_TOKEN`**. Every operator endpoint
  (`POST /api/disbursements`, `POST /api/anchor/manual`,
  `GET /tg/internal/pending-requests`, `POST /tg/internal/send-code`)
  is served by `vault-operator`, which validates the token
  (constant-time) and forwards the request to the right downstream
  Worker via Cloudflare service binding:
  - `/api/disbursements` → `vault-api-write`
  - `/api/anchor/manual` → `vault-anchor-cron`
  - `/tg/internal/*` → `tg-bot`
  The downstream Workers do not hold `OPERATOR_TOKEN` and are not
  publicly routable for these routes.
- **Reasoning:** the rejected alternatives were (a) share
  `OPERATOR_TOKEN` between `vault-api-write` and `tg-bot` (a leak
  in one Worker compromises both) and (b) split into two tokens
  (`VAULT_OPERATOR_TOKEN` + `BOT_OPERATOR_TOKEN`, two secrets, two
  rotations, two-token UI for a single-operator MVP). The single
  operator Worker gives one trust boundary, one secret, one
  rotation, and the cleanest possible blast-radius narrowing. A
  debug-log leak in `tg-bot` cannot capture the token because the
  secret is not present. Service bindings are in-process and
  not-publicly-routable, so the downstream Workers are not exposed
  to the public internet for the operator routes; a binding
  allowlist CI test enforces this.
- **Migration trigger:** when the operator count grows to 2+, the
  single `OPERATOR_TOKEN` is shared across humans, and a real leak
  becomes a real cost. The split into two or more tokens is then
  worth the operational overhead. Until then, the single Worker
  is the right MVP choice.

### Solana web3.js v1 (not v2)

- **Where:** `01-architecture.md`, `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- **Decision:** use `@solana/web3.js` v1 (`^1.98.4`) and `@solana/spl-token` v1
  (`^0.4.14`). Both packages are on the `latest` dist-tag on npm. v2 is on
  the `next` dist-tag (a major API rewrite) and `@solana/spl-token` v2
  does not exist on `latest` at all.
- **Reasoning:** v1 is the stable, widely-deployed choice. Every
  third-party Solana tool — Python `solana-py`, Rust `solana-sdk`,
  Helius docs, donor-facing verifiers — targets v1. The MVP's
  trust-critical claim "donors can write their own verifier in any
  language" depends on the v1 wire format and SDK shape. Pinning
  to v2 would mean pinning to a `next` channel, accepting pre-release
  semantics, and committing to a verification ecosystem that does
  not yet target the v2 API. v1 is "in maintenance mode" but
  maintenance means security patches continue, not abandonment.
  When v2 reaches `latest` and the ecosystem migrates, we will
  evaluate a one-week migration window.
- **Migration trigger:** v2 becomes `latest` AND has at least one
  stable patch release AND the Helius + donor-verifier ecosystem
  publishes v2-compatible libraries. Until all three hold, stay on
  v1.

### Public project name is "Open Care" (not "Crypto Charity Vault" or "Открытый фонд помощи")

- **Where:** the `/about` and `/faq` SvelteKit pages (prerendered
  static), `01-architecture.md`, `docs/concepts/2026-06-14-crypto-charity-vault.md`.
  Note: there are no `/api/about` or `/api/faq` JSON endpoints; the
  copy is committed to the SvelteKit source and rendered at build
  time.
- **Decision:** the public-facing brand string is **Open Care**,
  matching the operational `open-care.org` domain and the
  `open-care-web` Pages project. The on-chain Memo prefix `ccv-anchor:`
  and the AES-GCM AAD `ccv:tg-chat-route:` are a technical project
  shorthand, not a public brand.
- **Reasoning:** the operational infrastructure (domain, Pages
  project, Cloudflare account) is already "open-care"; the
  alternative "Crypto Charity Vault" is in the concept doc and
  prototype but is not in any operational config. Switching the
  public-facing string to match ops is the cheapest path. The HTML
  prototype uses "Открытый фонд помощи" as a placeholder and will be
  updated to "Open Care" (Russian copy preserved at the section level
  where it appears).

### Hash chain canonicalization is RFC 8785 (JCS)

- **Where:** `02-invariants.md` §I-3, `03-data-model.md` §"Event hash"
  and §"Normative test vector", `04-api.md` §"Conventions".
- **Decision:** the `canonical_json` function in the hash preimage is
  RFC 8785 (JSON Canonicalization Scheme). A normative test vector
  with pinned canonical bytes and pinned `event_hash` is checked
  into the spec so any donor verifier in any language can be
  validated against it.
- **Reasoning:** the previous spec described canonicalization as a
  list of rules (sorted keys, integer strings, etc.) without pinning
  a standard. Two conformant implementations could produce different
  bytes for the same input. RFC 8785 is the de facto standard for
  cryptographic canonicalization and has libraries in TypeScript,
  Python, Rust, and Go. The normative test vector catches
  regressions.

### Anchor lock protocol and crash recovery

- **Where:** `02-invariants.md` §I-4, `03-data-model.md` §"anchor_runs",
  `04-api.md` §"POST /api/anchor/manual".
- **Decision:** the anchor worker uses `anchor_runs.locked_until_utc`
  to serialize concurrent cron + manual anchor attempts. A run
  sets `status='sending', locked_until_utc = now() + 10 minutes` on
  start. Concurrent attempts find the active lock and return
  `409 CONFLICT` with `error.code: "ANCHOR_RUN_IN_PROGRESS"`. A
  cron tick that finds a stale lock (`updated_at_utc < now() - 10min`)
  looks up the on-chain transaction; if finalized, it appends a
  backfill `anchor_published` event with `created_at_utc = published_at_utc`
  (the on-chain block time), so the event hash preimage is
  independent of recovery time.
- **Reasoning:** without the lock, two concurrent anchor attempts
  would both send transactions with the same Memo text, wasting SOL
  and producing two `anchor_published` events with conflicting
  hashes. Without the recovery path, a Worker crash after tx
  finalization but before ledger append would leave an orphaned
  on-chain memo with no matching event.

### Correction policy is restricted and the public API is bivalent

- **Where:** `02-invariants.md` §I-11, `03-data-model.md` §"correction_recorded",
  `04-api.md`.
- **Decision:** `correction_recorded.replacement_fields` is a closed
  whitelist (`receipt_ref`, `service_note` only). Amounts, counts,
  chain fields, and timestamps are immutable; mistakes on those
  fields are corrected by appending a new event (a reversal or a
  re-recorded `disbursement_recorded`), not by a
  `correction_recorded`. The public read API returns the original
  event payload (matching the chain) verbatim; a future
  `?include=corrections` query parameter may return the correction
  chain in append order. The read API MUST NOT silently substitute
  corrected values for original values, because that would make a
  donor's offline verifier disagree with the JSON returned by the
  site.
- **Reasoning:** the previous spec allowed `replacement_fields` as
  a free-form object, which a malicious or careless operator could
  use to silently change `amount_usdc_minor` or `gift_card_count`.
  The trust story requires that the public JSON and the on-chain
  hash chain agree byte-for-byte; a bivalent API is the only way
  to keep that promise.

## Explicit deferrals

| Item | Why deferred | Trigger to revisit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Multi-sig treasury custody | Adds complexity before meaningful funds exist. | Treasury balance or operator count grows. |
| Cold storage workflow | Manual MVP custody is enough to validate the model. | Larger sustained balance. |
| Automated conversion loop | Manual conversion is a validation requirement. | Operator time exceeds target. |
| Receipt image storage | Receipt references are enough to start; images need redaction/storage policy. | Donors ask for visual proof. |
| Automated receipt verification | Needs platform API or opt-in beneficiary proof. | Receipt authenticity becomes donor blocker. |
| Public beneficiary signup | MVP beneficiaries are personally invited. | Beneficiary count grows beyond manual onboarding. |
| Referral / anti-abuse system | Not needed for a small invited cohort. | Abuse pressure appears. |
| Matrix or alternative messenger | Telegram is the practical MVP. | Telegram becomes unusable for the beneficiary group. |
| Psychiatry support | Initial scope is psychological support. | Separate legal/medical plan exists. |
| Multi-currency/cross-chain | USDC on Solana is enough to validate the product. | Repeated donor demand for another rail. |
| Donor accounts/recurring donations | Adds auth and privacy complexity. | Donor retention needs account features. |
| Exchange widget | Static instructions are enough to start. | Donation conversion becomes a major drop-off. |
| Queryable historical logs | Free live logs are enough initially. | Incidents require older log search. |

## Open questions

### How much receipt detail is public?

Default: publish `receipt_ref`, service, amount, count, and purchase date. Do
not publish screenshots or account emails. Revisit when donors need stronger
receipt evidence.

### How stable should `public_beneficiary_ref` be?

Default: `vault-operator` (forwarding to `vault-api-write`) generates a
fresh `^benpub_[A-Z0-9]{16}$` public reference per disbursement when
`POST /api/disbursements` omits `public_beneficiary_ref`, or stores
no public reference when the caller sends `null`. Do not accept
caller strings or create a permanent per-person reference. If bot
conversation state stores this value, it stores only the
server-generated value returned by the disbursement write, never
request or operator input. Revisit if donors need longitudinal
aggregate counts without exposing handles.

### How often should reconciliation run?

Default: daily plus manual on webhook incidents. Revisit if donation volume or
Helius delivery behavior requires tighter latency.

### What is the donor report SLA?

Default: weekly triage for non-urgent reports; immediate action for real hash
mismatches or secret incidents.
