# MVP Technical Spec

**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** 2026-06-18
**Scope:** MVP (Phase 1). Phase 2 is explicitly out of scope unless named as a product roadmap item.

This spec turns the product direction into an implementation-ready design.
All 8 epics are complete, 620 tests pass, CI green, all Workers + frontend deployed to staging.

The concept docs preserved the product intent: Solana + USDC donations,
a donor-verifiable ledger, manual conversion into therapy gift cards,
and a privacy-bounded Telegram beneficiary channel. The files in this
directory are the current technical design.

## Current design summary

- **Donation rail:** Solana SPL USDC only. Donations are transfers to the vault USDC associated token account (ATA), not native SOL transfers.
- **Ledger:** `ledger_events` is the canonical append-only donor ledger. Convenience typed tables/views may exist, but public verification is based on ledger event payloads.
- **Hash chain:** each ledger event commits to `sequence_no`, `event_type`, `payload`, `prev_hash`, and `created_at_utc`. `event_hash` is never included in its own preimage. The canonicalization standard is **RFC 8785 (JCS)**; a normative test vector with expected bytes and expected `event_hash` is pinned in `03-data-model.md` §"Normative test vector" so any donor verifier in any language can be checked against it.
- **Anchoring:** the anchor wallet signs a Solana Memo instruction containing UTF-8 text `ccv-anchor:<64hex head_hash>`. The memo anchors the head before the anchor publication event. Concurrent cron + manual anchor attempts are serialized via `anchor_runs.locked_until_utc`; a Worker crash after on-chain finalization is recovered by a backfill event whose `created_at_utc` equals the on-chain block time.
- **Wallet split:** the treasury wallet/ATA receives USDC and has no private key in CI or Workers. The anchor wallet holds only SOL for transaction fees.
- **Ingest:** Helius webhooks authenticate by the configured `authHeader` echoed in `Authorization` (constant-time comparison), ACK quickly, store a durable inbox row keyed by `(signature, source)`, and process/reconcile asynchronously.
- **Privacy:** internal handles are sensitive pseudonymous data. Bot storage uses keyed HMAC Telegram user references and encrypted Telegram chat routes, not plaintext Telegram IDs. Public examples use server-generated `public_beneficiary_ref` values or omit beneficiary references. Donor memos are not exposed publicly by default.
- **Public brand:** the project's public name is **Open Care** (matching the `open-care.org` domain and `open-care-web` Pages project). The technical prefix `ccv-` used in the on-chain Memo (`ccv-anchor:...`) and the AES-GCM AAD (`ccv:tg-chat-route:...`) is a project shorthand, not a public brand string.
