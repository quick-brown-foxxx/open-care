# tools/localnet — Agent Notes

## Role

Reusable local Solana validator tooling for realistic blockchain fixture setup.
This package is development/test infrastructure only; it never uses devnet,
mainnet, operator, treasury, or deployment secrets.

## What lives here

| File                         | Role                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/fixtures.ts`            | Reusable Solana localnet helpers for throwaway keypairs, token accounts, checked/unchecked SPL transfers, and memo transactions.                             |
| `src/validator.ts`           | Local `solana-test-validator` preflight, startup, readiness polling, process cleanup, and temp directory handling.                                          |
| `src/run-local-validator.ts` | CLI harness behind `pnpm run blockchain:local-validator`; starts an isolated validator, creates fixtures, runs a smoke or optional command, and tears down. |
| `test/blockchain.test.ts`    | Vitest local-validator integration tests for real Memo anchors, SPL Token transfers, ingest filtering/idempotency, and hash-chain verification.             |

## Connections

### Depends on

- `@solana/web3.js` — local RPC connections, keypairs, transactions, and memo instructions.
- `@solana/spl-token` — official SPL Token JS helpers for mints, associated token accounts, minting, and transfers.
- Local Solana CLI tooling — `solana-test-validator` must be available on `PATH` unless the harness is run with `--allow-skip`.

### Connected to

- Future blockchain Vitest tests can import `@open-care/localnet/fixtures` and use the CLI harness for a real localnet.
- Root script `blockchain:local-validator` delegates to this package.

## Key invariants

- Generated fixture keypairs are throwaway localnet material and stay in process memory unless a helper explicitly needs to persist one.
- Temporary validator ledgers are removed on normal exit and failure unless `--keep-ledger` is explicitly passed.
- The package must not read or require devnet/mainnet secrets, treasury keys, Helius credentials, D1 bindings, or Cloudflare bindings.
- Preflight failures for missing `solana-test-validator` must be explicit and fast; `--allow-skip` converts that expected local-machine limitation into a zero-exit skip.
