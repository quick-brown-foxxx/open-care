# OpenCode Agent Notes

For system architecture and feature map, see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).
For development workflow, commands, and local setup, see [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Agent rules for docs

- **Per-app/package AGENTS.md.** Each app (`apps/*/AGENTS.md`) and shared package
  (`packages/*/AGENTS.md`) has a scoped agent notes file describing its role,
  routes/bindings, key source files, connections to other components, and key
  invariants. When you add, remove, or change behavior in an app or package,
  update its AGENTS.md to match. When you create a new app or package, create
  its AGENTS.md following the same structure.
- **DEVELOPMENT.md owns all dev commands.** Every `pnpm run ...`, `wrangler ...`,
  `curl ...`, and similar operational command lives in `DEVELOPMENT.md`. Do not
  duplicate dev commands in AGENTS.md or ARCHITECTURE.md. If you add a new
  script, quality gate, deploy step, or local dev command, update
  `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md is the system map.** It explains how components fit together
  at a high level. Update it when the component map, data flow, trust
  boundaries, or feature descriptions change.
- **All docs are stateless.** No "Status: done", "Implemented in epic N", or
  similar stateful markers. The only forward-looking content allowed is in
  "Future work" sections.

## Project shape

- Cloudflare Workers monorepo, pnpm workspace (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, `tools/*`).
- Runtime is **stateless V8 isolate per request**; persistence is D1, not memory.
- Package manager: `pnpm@11.6.0`.

| `apps/web`         | (Pages)             | —                                                                                                                                         | —                                                                                                                                      |

**`vault-operator` is the sole holder of `OPERATOR_TOKEN`.** All operator-authenticated
endpoints (`/api/disbursements`, `/api/anchor/manual`, `/tg/internal/pending-requests`,
`/tg/internal/send-code`) flow through it; the token is never in
`vault-api-write` or `tg-bot`. Service bindings are in-process and
not-publicly-routable, so the downstream Workers are not exposed to the
public internet for these routes. See
[`docs/specs/01-architecture.md`](docs/specs/01-architecture.md) §"Operator
Worker trust model" for the full design.

**`vault-api-read`** exposes the public, no-auth surface
(`/api/totals`, `/api/donations`, `/api/disbursements` (the public list, not
the write), `/api/ledger-events`, `/api/verify`, `/api/health`). The
`/api/health.anchor_wallet_low_sol` field reads the cached
`anchor_runs.last_anchor_wallet_sol_lamports` value written by
`vault-anchor-cron`; the read Worker has no RPC binding.

All Workers use Hono. Main export is the Hono app from `src/index.ts`.

| `@open-care/vault-db`   | Drizzle schemas (6 tables), ledger append helper, query helpers, client factories                              |
| `@open-care/bot-crypto` | HMAC-SHA256 user ref derivation, AES-GCM chat ID encryption/decryption, base64url                              |

## Migration directory location

D1 migration directories live inside specific app directories rather than a
neutral shared location:

| Database   | Migration directory       | Owner app      |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| `vault-db` | `apps/ingest/migrations/` | `vault-ingest` |
| `bot-db`   | `apps/tg-bot/migrations/` | `tg-bot`       |

**Why this asymmetry exists:**

- Cloudflare D1 migrations are **per-database**, not per-Worker. A single
  `wrangler d1 migrations apply vault-db` command applies all pending
  migrations to the `vault-db` database, regardless of which Worker directory
  the command is run from.
- `vault-db` is shared across multiple Workers (`vault-ingest`, `vault-api-read`,
  `vault-api-write`, `vault-anchor-cron`). The migrations could live in any of
  these apps, but they must live in exactly one.
- `vault-ingest` was chosen as the designated "owner" app for `vault-db`
  migrations because it is the first Worker that writes to the database
  (ingesting donations from the Helius webhook).
- `bot-db` migrations live in `apps/tg-bot/migrations/` following the same
  pattern — `tg-bot` is the sole owner of `bot-db`.
- Test configurations reference the migration directory explicitly:
  `apps/api-read/vitest.config.ts` imports migrations from
  `../../apps/ingest/migrations` via `readD1Migrations()`.
- The deploy script (`pnpm run deploy`) applies migrations from the
  canonical locations before deploying Workers.

**Do not move migration directories** without updating all references
(vitest configs, deploy scripts, CI, and this documentation).

## Key constraints

- **Stateless.** No in-memory caches between requests. Use D1 for persistence.
- **CPU limit.** 30s per request. Long work goes in `ctx.waitUntil()`.
- **D1 latency.** Reads can be 5–50ms depending on edge location. Public endpoints
  use 60s cache TTLs (per spec `04-api.md`).
- **Secrets.** Accessed via `c.env.SECRET_NAME` (Hono bindings), not `process.env`.
- **No treasury key.** The treasury private key is never in Workers, CI, or repo.
  Operator custody only.

## Key decisions

| Decision              | Choice                                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Hash canonicalization | RFC 8785 (JCS), normative test vector pinned  |
| Solana SDK            | `@solana/web3.js` v1 (`^1.98.4`)              |
| HTTP routing          | Hono                                          |
| Validation            | Zod (backend), Valibot (frontend)             |
| ORM                   | Drizzle with D1 driver                        |
| Test runner           | Vitest                                        |
| Browser tests         | Playwright                                    |
| Telegram E2E          | Telethon + pytest (manual/nightly, not PR CI) |

## Future work

- Design phase (replace disposable frontend layers with production design)
- Mainnet launch (after production secrets and domain setup)
- Local realistic simulation and Solana interaction testing (localnet orchestration, webhook simulation fixtures, chain-state seeders)
