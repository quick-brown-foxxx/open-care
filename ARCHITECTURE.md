# Architecture & Feature Map

How the Open Care system works, what each component does, and how they connect.

## System overview

Open Care is a transparent crypto charity platform. Donors send USDC on Solana;
every donation, disbursement, and correction is recorded in a public,
hash-chained append-only ledger. A daily Solana Memo transaction anchors the
ledger head hash on-chain. Beneficiaries receive gift-card codes via Telegram.

The system runs on Cloudflare Workers (edge compute) with D1 (SQLite-at-edge)
for persistence. There is no long-running server — every request gets a fresh V8
isolate.

## Data flow

```text
Donor sends USDC → Helius webhook → vault-ingest → ledger_events (donation_confirmed)
                                                         │
Operator records disbursement → vault-operator → vault-api-write → ledger_events (disbursement_recorded)
                                                         │
Daily cron → vault-anchor-cron → Solana Memo tx → ledger_events (anchor_published)
                                                         │
Public reads ← vault-api-read ← vault-db (ledger_events, wallets, anchor_runs)
                                                         │
Beneficiary /start → tg-bot → bot-db (handles, conversations)
Operator sends code → vault-operator → tg-bot → Telegram delivery
```

| `apps/api-write`   | Append-only write path for disbursements and corrections. No public route — reached only via service binding from `vault-operator`.                                                      | None                                                                | Trusts operator (in-process binding)       |

| `apps/operator`    | Auth gateway. Sole holder of `OPERATOR_TOKEN`. Forwards authenticated requests to `vault-api-write`, `vault-anchor-cron`, `tg-bot` via service bindings. Also serves operator UI routes. | Routes `/api/disbursements`, `/api/anchor/manual`, `/tg/internal/*` | Constant-time token comparison             |
| `apps/tg-bot`      | Telegram bot: `/start`, `/card`, `/whoami`, `/help`. HMAC-derived user refs, AES-GCM encrypted chat IDs. Code delivery with hash/last4 retention.                                        | Route `/tg/webhook`                                                 | Telegram webhook secret                    |
| `apps/web`         | SvelteKit frontend (Cloudflare Pages). Public pages: landing, donate, ledger, verify, about, faq, contact.

- **`vault-operator` is the sole holder of `OPERATOR_TOKEN`.** The token never leaves this Worker.
- **`vault-anchor-cron` is the sole holder of `ANCHOR_WALLET_SECRET`.** The anchor wallet key never leaves this Worker.
- **Service bindings are in-process and not publicly routable.** Downstream Workers (`vault-api-write`, `vault-anchor-cron`, `tg-bot` internal routes) are not exposed to the internet.
- **The treasury private key is never in any Worker, CI, or repo.** Operator custody only.
- **`tg-bot` stores no plaintext Telegram IDs or chat IDs.** User refs are HMAC-SHA256; chat IDs are AES-GCM encrypted.

## Feature map

### Donation flow

1. Donor sends USDC to the vault's USDC ATA on Solana
2. Helius webhook notifies `vault-ingest` (ACK fast, process async)
3. `vault-ingest` fetches the transaction, parses the SPL transfer, validates amount/mint/ATA
4. Appends `donation_confirmed` to `ledger_events` with hash chain
5. Reconciliation cron catches any missed transactions every 6 hours

### Disbursement flow

1. Operator purchases gift cards, records via `/admin/disbursements`
2. `vault-operator` validates token, forwards to `vault-api-write`
3. `vault-api-write` validates payload (Zod), generates `benpub_` ref, appends `disbursement_recorded`
4. Public can see disbursement in ledger (amount, service, receipt ref, beneficiary ref)

### Anchor flow

1. Daily cron (01:00 UTC) triggers `vault-anchor-cron`
2. Reads ledger head hash, builds `ccv-anchor:<64hex>` Memo instruction
3. Signs and sends Solana transaction from anchor wallet
4. On success: appends `anchor_published` to ledger
5. Manual trigger available via operator `/api/anchor/manual`
6. Lock protocol prevents concurrent anchor attempts; stale lock recovery built in

### Verification

1. Public `/verify` page shows current head hash and latest anchor memo
2. Anyone can export the full ledger (`/api/ledger-events`)
3. Anyone can independently verify with `tools/verify/verify-chain.ts`: recompute hash chain, check anchor memo matches the anchored ledger head, and confirm anchor tx metadata exposed by `/api/verify`

### Beneficiary flow (Telegram)

1. Beneficiary sends `/start <handle>` to the Telegram bot
2. `tg-bot` derives HMAC-SHA256 user ref, encrypts chat ID with AES-GCM
3. Beneficiary requests card with `/card`
4. Operator sees pending requests (redacted — no plaintext IDs) via `/admin`
5. Operator sends gift-card code → `tg-bot` delivers to beneficiary
6. After delivery: only hash + last4 retained; full code encrypted with short TTL for retry

### Corrections

1. Operator can correct a previous event's `receipt_ref` or `service_note` via `POST /api/corrections`
2. Whitelist enforcement: only those two fields can be replaced
3. Original `payload_json` preserved byte-for-byte in read API (bivalent)
4. Correction is itself a hash-chained ledger event

## Future work

- Design phase (replace disposable frontend layers with production design)
- Mainnet launch (after production secrets and domain setup)
- Local realistic simulation and Solana interaction testing (blockchain test cases,
  webhook simulation fixtures, chain-state seeders)
